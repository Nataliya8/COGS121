Contributions: 
Overall, we took on different tasks every milestone where we didn't just work on one part of the app for the whole quarter. If someone would struggle with their task, another person would jump in and see if they can help figure it out. We worked cooperatively to accomplish all the different tasks that were required to build all the parts of our app.

- Completed tasks I signed up for in order to develop the app more every milestone including creating some of the goals pages, working on css, helping with some of the backend, and other non-coding related tasks in the milestones.
