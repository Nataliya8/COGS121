These skeletons are noticeably different from those in milestone2. We now have Icon Baron the bottom of each page. Goal1 includes a new feature to will open camera and take a picture. The Goal Overview Page includes some pins on the map. Also, the Rewards Page includes progress barto show the progress toward the next prize. Overall, all pages are more organized.
