We received great feedback from our TA on our idea for our app so we decided to go forward with it. The idea of our app is the same as what we proposed in Milestone 1. Just to recap, however, our proposed idea for our app is a scavenger hunt type game designed mainly for kids with the intended purpose for them to go out and explore nature more rather than always being inside on various technological devices. Our app would use technology to promote a more natural lifestyle while also allowing children and their parents to play the game and explore together.

Our pages correspond to paper prototype2.jpg from Milestone 1. We did not change much from the paper prototype; however, there are a few changes to the home page specifically. We added a "login" button and a "rewards" button to the home screen. We wanted to ensure the user had the ability to navigate to any screen from the home page easily rather than needing to click multiple buttons. The login feature will enable users to login to their specific "game" that they have started. We are also thinking of adding a feature to the app in the future to enable parents to login under a parent account to be able to track their child and their progress in the game; however, for now it is just a child logged into the game.
