paragraph describing how someone in your target user population would use your app in order to help them achieve relevant goals. Think of this as a storyboard (setting+sequence+satisfaction) except written in a paragraph instead of using drawings.

Our app was designed for children, mainly under the age of 10, to be able to explore the world with their parents and use technology to complete different goals in the real world, rather than just virtually in an app. For example, we have a seven year old child Nick. Nick's mom is concerned that he is too addicted to technology and the ipad so she installs Play Pal on the ipad. She then lets Nick login to the app and choose where he wants to explore first. Nick chooses to go to the beach. So his mom drives them both to the beach and they complete the three tasks together, earning points for completing each task. If Nick and his mom are feeling more adventurous, they could venture to the nearby park and complete the tasks there too. Once all the tasks are completed, both Nick and his mom are satisfied with a fun-filled day full of different adventures they were able to explore together. Nick had fun and his mom was able to teach Nick about the amazing things one can find in nature, with the assistance of the technology, but not making it the sole focus.

explanation of how your UI's screenshots have improved 

This week we were able to finish the rest of the goals for the 3 different locations (mall, park, and beach). We also updated the home page to include a sign up feature rather than just the simple login so users can create a new account if they do not have one yet. We also updated the styling on the rewards page and included some actual rewards that users can redeem their points for within the app.
